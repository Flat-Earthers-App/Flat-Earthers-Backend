# FE Backend
This repository holds the backend code for the NASA Space Challenge. It is developed using .NET and C# with the MVC framework. The backend strictly provides RESTful web APIs and is fully separated from the frontend.

### Temporary / Contributions
All modifications should be made in the `preparation` branch rather than the main branch until the project is finalized.
